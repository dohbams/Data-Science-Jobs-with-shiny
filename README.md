# Data-Science-Jobs-with-shiny

Welcome! This repo is dedicated to recreating my friend, [Malcom's](https://github.com/Ebuka456) Tableau dashboard using the shiny package in R. Credit to him for providing an already cleaned dataset. You can check out his original version of the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/okonkwo.malcom.chukwuebuka/viz/DataScienceJobs_16629787997780/Dashboard1).

## Introduction :wave:

The data industry has been fast booming all over the world as organizations and businesses have begun to cultivate data culture in order to leverage the power of data to derive insights to improve business and operations. There are a plethora of data roles in high demand all over the world and in Nigeria. This dashboard summarises the Data Science Jobs dataset which was originally obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries?select=ds_salaries.csv). The dataset consists of Data science jobs from 2020 to 2022, the company location, the experience level requirements and several other fields. It has of 607 records and 12 columns. As earlier stated, the dashb0ard was created using shiny and can be accessed via this [link](...). Enjoy!!

### Potential Future Improvements :star:
More interactivity can be added to the dashboard in form of tooltips and on-click filtering. That is, filtering the entire dashboard when a user clicks on a single bar of a bar chart, by the parameter that bar represents.
More pages could also be added to highlight the spatial relationships between salaries and company locations.
