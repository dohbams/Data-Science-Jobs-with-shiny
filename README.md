# Data-Science-Jobs-with-shiny

Welcome! This repo is dedicated to recreating my friend, [Malcom's](https://github.com/Ebuka456) Tableau dashboard using the shiny package in R. Credit to him for providing an already cleaned dataset. You can check out his original version of the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/okonkwo.malcom.chukwuebuka/viz/DataScienceJobs_16629787997780/Dashboard1).

## Introduction :wave:

The data industry has been rapidly expanding around the world as businesses and organizations have started to foster a data culture in order to take advantage of the potential of data to provide insights that will help them run and improve their operations. Numerous data-related positions are in high demand worldwide and in Nigeria. This project was carried out in order to develop a dashboard that would summarise the Data Science Jobs dataset which was originally obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries?select=ds_salaries.csv). The dataset consists of Data science jobs from 2020 to 2022, the company location, the experience level requirements and several other fields. It has of 607 records and 12 columns. As earlier stated, the dashboard was created using shiny and can be accessed via this [link](https://dohbams.shinyapps.io/data-science-jobs/?_ga=2.162430015.287209543.1668194476-61114262.1666020806). Enjoy!!

### Potential Future Improvements :star:
More interactivity can be added to the dashboard in form of tooltips and on-click filtering. That is, filtering the entire dashboard when a user clicks on a single bar of a bar chart, by the parameter that bar represents.
More pages could also be added to highlight the spatial relationships between salaries and company locations.
